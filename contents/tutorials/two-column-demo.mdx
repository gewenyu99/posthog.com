# Understanding Two-Column Layouts in PostHog

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the two-column layout feature in PostHog tutorials. The two-column layout is perfect for explainer-style content where you want to present information in a more spacious, readable format.

## Why Use Two Columns?

Two-column layouts offer several advantages:

1. **Better Space Utilization**: Makes better use of wide screens
2. **Improved Readability**: Creates a more comfortable reading experience
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Helps organize content more effectively
4. **Modern Design**: Provides a contemporary look and feel

## How to Enable Two Columns

To enable the two-column layout, simply add `twoColumn: true` to your frontmatter:

```mdx

title: "Your Tutorial Title"
date: "2024-03-20"
twoColumn: true
---
```

## Best Practices


When using two-column layouts, consider these best practices:

1. **Content Organization**: Structure your content to flow naturally in the wider format
2. **Visual Elements**: Use images and diagrams that benefit from the extra space
3. **Code Examples**: Take advantage of the wider space for code snippets
4. **Responsive Design**: Remember that the layout will stack on mobile devices

## Example Code Block

Here's an example of how code looks in the two-column layout:

```javascript
// Example code block
const posthog = require('posthog-js')

posthog.init('your-project-api-key', {
    api_host: 'https://app.posthog.com'
})

// Track an event
posthog.capture('tutorial_viewed', {
    tutorial_name: 'two-column-demo'
})
```

## Using Images

Images can be particularly effective in the two-column layout:
